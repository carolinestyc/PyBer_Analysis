# PyBer_Analysis
   Challenge 5
## Project Overview
My new boss at PyBer, V. Isualize, has given Omar and I a new assignment. She has asked for a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Using this analysis and summary, the differences by city type are extrapolated and can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 
### Resources
            Data Sources: city_ride.csv & ride_data.csv
            
            Software: Python 3.9.7 & Jupyter Notebook
