# PyBer_Analysis
   Challenge 5
## Project Overview
My new boss at PyBer, V. Isualize, has given Omar and I a new assignment. She has asked for a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Using this analysis and summary, the differences by city type are extrapolated and can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 
### Resources
            Data Sources: city_ride.csv & ride_data.csv
            
            Software: Python 3.9.7 & Jupyter Notebook
## Results
By aggregating and analyzing the provided PyBer ride-share data, the differences in use among city type are clear. As you can see in the summary table below, rural cities have much fewer rides and drivers, therefore collecting fewer money in total fares. As we move into urban cities, ridership goes up almost 13% and fares increase by over 9%. This should come as no surprise as population and desnity are much higher in urban areas compared to rural areas. There is a larger population of both users and available drivers in urban cities and even suburban cities than rural cities to increase ride-share usage and decrease the average fare per ride and driver. Based on geographical patterns of cities, we can also assume rides in urban cities are shorter as the area is much denser and rides in suburban and rural areas are longer distances as the area is more dispersed. Therefore, costing more money to riders.
