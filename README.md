# PyBer_Analysis
   Challenge 5
## Project Overview
My new boss at PyBer, V. Isualize, has given Omar and I a new assignment. She has asked for a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Using this analysis and summary, the differences by city type are extrapolated and can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 
### Resources
            Data Sources: city_ride.csv & ride_data.csv
            
            Software: Python 3.9.7 & Jupyter Notebook
## Results
By aggregating and analyzing the provided PyBer ride-share data, the differences in use among city type are clear. As you can see in the summary table below, rural cities have much fewer rides and drivers, therefore collecting fewer money in total fares. As we move into urban cities, ridership goes up 12 times and total fares increase by over 9 times rural cities. This should come as no surprise as population and density are much higher in urban areas compared to rural areas. There is a larger population of both users and available drivers in urban and suburban cities than rural cities to increase ride-share usage and decrease the average fare per ride and driver. Based on geographical patterns of cities, we can also assume rides in urban cities are shorter as the area is much denser than suburban and rural areas; so rides are longer distances as the area is more dispersed. Therefore, costing more money to riders as distance increases and available drivers decrease.

In fact, the data shows that urban cities have almost 5 times the number of drivers as suburban cities and over 30 times as many in rural cities. Additionally, average fares per drivers is only $16.57 in urban cities but $55.49 in rural cities. Although the average fare is much higher in rural cities, ride usage is so low that total fares only amounted to $4,328. 4.5 times less than suburban cities where total fares were $19,356 and 9 times less than urban cities where total fares amounted to $39,854.

In the multiple line graph below, we can see the pattern in fares by city type across the months of January to April 2019. As discussed previously, total fares are lowest in rural cities and highest in urban cities for all 4 months. Interestingly, each city type does not experience the same ridership pattern. Rural communities saw the highest total fare count in early April but suburban cities saw a spike in late February. Urban cities saw highest usage in late February and then again in early March. Although this graph goes week by week, we may see additional patterns if broken up day by day to see what days of the week saw higher usage.

## Summary
Based on my findings in the PyBer ride share data, there are three (3) recommendations to PyBer decision makers for addressing disparities among city types. First, incentivize becoming a PyBer driver in rural areas to increase the number of available drivers. This will help decrease the average fare per ride in rural communities by increasing supply. Utimately making ride-share more financially accessible to riders. Which leads to my second recommendation, increasing ridership in rural communities. If you can decrease prices for rural riders, you will increase ridership and revenue, therefore decreasing average fares. Utilizing focused marketing for these communities may help acheive this goal as well. And finally, increase price per mileage in urban cities so drivers make more money per trip. For the density reasons discussed previously, rides are probably shorter in urban cities so drivers are receiving less average pay ($16.57). To encourage their return as drivers, incentive them with higher pay per mileage to increase their pay per trip. Increaseing price per mileage in urban cities will increase revenue for PyBer as it is the most active market. This can also be acheived by decreasing the number of drivers in urban cities so the average fare per driver will increase. However, prices should not be increased too high because it will begin too push riders out of the market; decreasing ridership, therefore decreasing revenue for PyBer.
